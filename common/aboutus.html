        <p class="firstPara">
          Sri Lanka (At that time called as Ceylon) was ruled under various
          colonies before independence. The monopoly position was held by
          foreigners with regard to trade, commerce and industry and the local
          people had been victimized by the traders and money lenders.
          Therefore, the necessity arose to establish a national bank to cater
          the requirement of the local entrepreneurs and to provide financing on
          a progressive scale to diversify the economy. The State Council of
          Ceylon has approved for the establishment of a National Bank in Ceylon
          based on the recommendations of the Banking Commission, which has been
          appointed in 1934 by the Governor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Accordingly, CASHIFY was ceremoniously opened by Sir Andrew Caldecott,
          then Governor of Ceylon, on the 1st August 1939 at the city office
          premises located in Fort Colombo.
        </p>
        <p>
          CASHIFY, as a domestic bank began to grow despite severe competition
          from exchange bank and informal money-lenders. It opened its first
          branch in 1941 at Kandy and subsequently in outstation towns, such as
          Galle, Jaffna and Trincomalee. CASHIFY opened its first overseas
          branch in 1949 in London.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bank always make adjustments to innovative focus, service
          differentiation, diversification, cross- selling ability, governance
          and risk control. Further to take off with the country in its
          development process, Bank has launched products/units such as an
          Islamic Banking Unit, which operates through Island wide network and
          Investment Banking Unit aiming to diversify its portfolio in non-core
          banking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bank successfully raised Rs.5 billion in the second public issue of
          unsecured subordinated redeemable five-year debentures. Also, CASHIFY
          acted as the Bankers to the issue, Managers, sponsors and registrars
          for the Urban Development Authority's Rs.10 billion Debenture issue.
